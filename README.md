# 128-bit AES-Algorithm

##Synopsis
Sample codes(C++) for both encryption and decryption using AES algorithm.

##File Details
-encryption_aes.cpp: Source file for encryption utility
-decryption_aes.cpp: Source file for decryption utility
-keyfile: Contains the symmetric key. The key is a 128-bit key in hexadecimal format with a space between each hex value, example: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F 10
-message.aes: Generated by encryption tool, stores the encrypted message. Read in and decrypted by decryption tool.

## Compilation
If using the g++ compiler you can do:   
**g++ encrypt.cpp -o encrypt**  
**g++ decrypt.cpp -o decrypt**

## Usage
To run the encryption utility simply do **./encrypt** after compilation.   
To run the decryption utility simply do **./decrypt** after compilation.
